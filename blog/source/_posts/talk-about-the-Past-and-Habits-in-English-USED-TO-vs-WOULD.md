## USED TO

Q: **How to use the "USED TO" ?**

A : describes something that was true in the distant past like childhood (but is not true now).So, we can use "used to"  without a specific time period. we don't have to say like when I was a kid, when I was in the school. because we use "used to" it's often in a situation where we can understand from context. **we also can use ''used to " for status or condition.** we can say like I used to be a teacher.

**EXAMPLES :**

1. I used to play soccer. [The mean I play soccer long long time age but now I do not play soccer.]

2. He used to hate bananas. 

3. I used to be a teacher [use "Used to " for statues or condition] [The mean a long time ago  I am a teacher, but now I am  not].
4. Where did you used to play?
5. Didn't you used to have a car?



## WOULD

Describes :  "used to " mean is same for "would" . we also use "would" to talk  something true before but is not true now. So this is the same. Ｗe tend to use "Would" with repeated action. For example something we did every year or every day or every month or every winter. **we will often kind of give more a little more detail when we use would.** We use would when like the general time period or the general situation is known. So this is a big different from "used to". and **we can not use "would" for status or conditions . we can only talk about actions ,That also is  difference from "used to".**



When we make a sentence with "would", we typically combine we typically put it together with some information about the time period or another detail .

**FOR EXAMPLE :**

1. When I was a kid , I would collect stamps and put them in a box in my room.
2. When he was in college, he would go out to crazy parities every weekend.
3. **When she was little, she would leave her clothes all over the house.[When she was little is a very common sentence we can use.] [ leave her clothes doesn't mean 离开她的衣服, it's mean to forget things like you place something somewhere and you go away,so we use the verb leave to describe that]**



# Use these together with simple past tense

1. Introduce the concept with "Used to" (no specific time period)
2. Give details (a repeated action) with "Would"(specific time period)
3. End with the past tense statement(memory) or a present tense statement (the situation now).

**EXAMPLE:**

1. I used to live with a really messy roommate. Every week, the guy would leave his dirty dishes in the sink and wait for me to clean them up!  I eventually moved out.

2. My parents used to live around here. When I worked in this neighborhood. I would go to their house every week for dinner, and my mom makes amazing food and my dad is pretty good with barbecue.
